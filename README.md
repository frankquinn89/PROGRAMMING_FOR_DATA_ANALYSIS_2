## The Project

This project focuses on analysing paleo-present climate data. 

## Project Outline

In this project we will :
* Analyse CO2 vs Temperature Anomaly from 800kyrs â€“ present.
* Examine another paleo/modern features - CH4
* Examine the topic in an Irish context
* Fuse and analyse data from various data sources and export to csv and json formats.
* Predict global temperature anomaly over next few decades and compare to published climate models if atmospheric CO2 trends continue
* Comment on accelerated warming based on very latest features (e.g. temperature/polar-icecoverage)


## File and folder info
* project.ipynb - this file contains the jupyter notebook of analysis on the topic area.
* source_data folder - this contains the source datasets for all the areas investigated.
* exported_data folder - this contains all the exported datasets that have been cleansed and fused from the project in CSV and JSON formats
